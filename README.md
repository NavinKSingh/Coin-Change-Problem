Coin Change Problem - Greedy Algorithm

Introduction

The Coin Change Problem is a classic optimization problem that involves finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount using a set of available denominations. The greedy algorithm provides an efficient approach to solving this problem under specific conditions.

Problem Statement

Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, determine the minimum number of coins required to make up the amount using a greedy strategy.

Example

Input:

Coin denominations: [1, 5, 10, 25]

Target amount: 63

Output:

Coins used: [25, 25, 10, 1, 1, 1]

Minimum number of coins: 6

Algorithm - Greedy Approach

Sort the coins in descending order.

Pick the largest denomination that does not exceed the remaining amount.

Subtract the chosen coin's value from the remaining amount.

Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the remaining amount is zero.
